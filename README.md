# 
Portfolio-project Project.

For this repository, I've created this project to practice what I have learned:
1. like github workflow
2. How to create github branches
3. How to commit repositories
4. How send pull request
5. And final how to request for code review.

I used ESlint to manage the files for the front-end, using loaders for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, in order to fix some special thing at the moment to use the front-end in a server. Feel free to suggest more additional features for this repository, or if you want to use it, feel free to do that as well.
