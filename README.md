Portfolio-project Project. | Mobile version and Window version

For this repository, I've created a project to add media query to the project to enable the users to view the application in a mobile frindly screen, also I've implemented a dynamic web app using CSS which is accessible on mobile screen of max width of 374px wide.

I used ESlint to manage the files for the front-end, using loaders for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, in order to fix some special thing at the moment to use the front-end in a server. Feel free to suggest more additional features for this repository, or if you want to use it, feel free to do that as well.
